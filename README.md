# COVID_viz

This project was made in the first semester of 2020 as the final work of the discipline of _Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization_. The objective of the visualization was to comprehend the dissemination patterns of the COVID-19 cases in the first months of the pandemic, from April to June, in the cities of SÃ£o Paulo (the state). The discussion about the development of the visualization and the results are available at the following (link)[https://giovanivaldrighi.github.io/COVID_viz/].

# Files organization

The files of the project are separated in the following folders:

- `/docs`: files for the web site that contains the documentation of the visualization.

- `script.Rmd`: main file that generates both the documentation and the final figure. 

# Requirements

The visualization was implemented with the (R)[https://www.r-project.org/] language and with (R-studio)[https://www.rstudio.com/] support to generate the markdown file. The used libraries, that can easily installed with R-studio, are:
